The collection of utility packages used by this project without being
specific to its internals.

Utility packages are kept separate from this project's core codebase to
keep it as small and concise as possible. If some utilities grow larger
and their APIs stabilize, they may be moved to their own repository, to
facilitate re-use by other projects. However that is not the priority.
